# NUMPY
This is learning numpy in python.NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. Built for performance, NumPy is the backbone of many data science, machine learning, and numerical computing workflows.
